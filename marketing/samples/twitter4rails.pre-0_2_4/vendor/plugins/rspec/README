== RSpec

RSpec is a Behaviour Definition Framework intended for use in Behaviour
Driven Development. RSpec plays the same role that a unit testing framework
would play in a Test Driven Development environment, but does so using
words and structures that better support BDD.

RSpec ships with four modules:

Spec::Matchers provides Expression Matchers for use with Spec::Expectations
and Spec::Mocks.

Spec::Expectations supports setting expectations on your objects so you
can do things like:

  result.should equal(expected_result)
  
Spec::Mocks supports creating Mock Objects, Stubs, and adding Mock/Stub
behaviour to your existing objects.

Spec::Runner provides a very small but powerful DSL for writing executable
examples of how your code should work.

== Installation

The simplest approach is to install the gem:

  gem install -r rspec #mac users must sudo

== Building the RSpec gem
If you prefer to build the gem locally, check out source from svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/trunk. Then
do the following:

  rake gem
  gem install pkg/rspec-0.x.x.gem (you may have to sudo)

== Running RSpec's specs
In order to run RSpec's full suite of specs (rake pre_commit) you must install the following gems:

* rake          # Runs the build script
* rcov          # Verifies that the code is 100% covered by specs
* webgen        # Generates the static HTML website
* RedCloth      # Required by webgen
* syntax        # Required by our own custom webgen extension to highlight ruby code
* diff-lcs      # Required if you use the --diff switch
* win32console  # Required by the --colour switch if you're on Windows
* meta_project  # Required in order to make releases at RubyForge
* heckle        # Required if you use the --heckle switch

Once those are all installed, you should be able to run the suite with the following steps:

* svn co svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/trunk rspec
* cd rspec
* rake install_dependencies
* cd example_rails_app
* export RSPEC_RAILS_VERSION=1.2.3
* rake rspec:generate_mysql_config
* mysql -u root < db/mysql_setup.sql
* cd ..
* rake pre_commit


Note that RSpec itself - once built - doesn't have any dependencies outside the Ruby core 
and stdlib - with a few exceptions:

* The spec command line uses diff-lcs when --diff is specified.
* The spec command line uses heckle when --heckle is specified.
* The Spec::Rake::SpecTask needs RCov if RCov is enabled in the task.

See http://rspec.rubyforge.org for further documentation.
