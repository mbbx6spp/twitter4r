= Upgrading existing code to RSpec-0.9

== General (see below for Spec::Rails specifics)

=== New Syntax for should and should_not

* Use translator (should get 90% of your code)
* Manually fix "parenthesis" warnings

=== Change before_context_eval to before_eval

before_context_eval is an un-published hook used by
Spec::Rails to create specialized behaviour contexts.
Most of you don't need to change this, but for those
who have exploited it, you'll need to change it to
before_eval.

== Spec::Rails

=== spec_helper.rb

We've added a new way to configure Spec::Runner to do
things like use_transactional_fixtures and use_instantiated_fixtures.
You'll need to update spec/spec_helper.rb accordingly. You can either
just re-generate it:

  script/generate rspec
  
Or modify spec_helper.rb based on the template, which can be found at:

  vendor/plugins/rspec_on_rails/generators/rspec/templates/spec_helper.rb
